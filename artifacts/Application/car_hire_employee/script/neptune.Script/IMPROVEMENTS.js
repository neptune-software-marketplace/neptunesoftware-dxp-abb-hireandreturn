// IMPROVEMENTS

// 1. Change ResponsivePopover to SAP.m.dialog to make it more mobile friendly!

// 2. Car Number to be a individual booking number 

// 4. Change "SAVE" Button inside of 2 page. Dont go back to main menu. Might be better for overall workflow with the new app setup.

// 6. Add Time frame of booking to first list and mark red if overdue!

// 7. Add NAME of the part to the JSON so we can clearly name the parths instead of path1 etc.

// 8. for loop over json paths if damaged. if yes mark car red.

// 9. Before handover and after handover JSON storage so we can later say if there are any new damages to the car and also which have changed.



// BONUS

// Add another app and table to check if cars available. Grey out in Add list if not available.

//REFACTORING

//1. Refactor Code to not set model in SimpleForm, since we do not use it anymore, go on Page level (maybe?)





// Stati : Ready (green), Rented (red), Returned (orange)
